# ThesisTimer

This project has been made for practice purposes only.
The application can be used to determine thesis (work) writing hours schedules based on your inputs (deadline, busy hours, etc.)
The project is small and does not require any additional explanation.

## Running ThesisTimer

As the application is not hosted on gh pages or any other place - 
Simply pull the code, get the latest dependencies required for the project via 'npm install' 
and run the application via 'npm start' command.
Good luck and have fun!
